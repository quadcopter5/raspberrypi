raspberrypi
===========

We can use this repository as a general place to share code. Later on we'll make a repository that will hold the actual Quadcopter project which will be running on the RPi, so we can keep the final project separate from our "fooling around" code.

In addition to that we'll also make another repository to hold the client application that will run on the PC, which will be used to control the Quadcopter remotely (send commands, receive feedback).

Please try to keep the code organized, i.e. make folders to keep unrelated files separate.
